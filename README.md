# SlidingCompany
A Lethal Company mod that allows the player to crouch-slide. (Still WIP, and may need a lot of adjustments)

Note: This mod currently causes desync in multiplayer. I will work on fixing this later

- You can now crouch-slide (uses stamina - the heavier you are the more stamina this will cost)
- You can now queue up a crouch or slide while in the air/jumping
- You can now jump while crouching or sliding
