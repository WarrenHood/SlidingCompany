# SlidingCompany

A Lethal Company mod that allows the player to crouch-slide. (Still WIP, and may need a lot of adjustments)

- You can now crouch-slide (uses stamina - the heavier you are the more stamina this will cost)
- You can now queue up a crouch or slide while in the air/jumping
- You can now jump while crouching or sliding

Changelog:

1.0.9:

- Significantly lowered crouch sliding audio volume
- Set the initial speed boost when starting a crouch slide very low
- Attempted to sync crouch sliding audio across clients (untested)

1.0.8:

- Removed the initial speed boost when starting a crouch slide

1.0.7:

### Fix

- Stopped sliding audio for dead players
- Stop sliding once we start climbing a ladder
